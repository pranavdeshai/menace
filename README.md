# menace

A Python implementation of MENACE (Matchbox Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine)

## About

The program provides a means to simulate the gameplay of the original MENACE, a mechanical artificial intelligence. It further helps understand the basics and operations of a simple neural network and fundamental concepts like weights and reinforcement which are the core of any AI.

## Demonstration

Some interesting results can be observed when the data is visualized. Some of them are shown below.

-   Simulation with random moves by opponent

## Requirements

-   **Python 3**: The program is written and tested in Python 3.10. To run the program efficiently, it is recommended to use it with the latest version of Python (3.10). However, older versions might also be supported.
